# SateLight: A Satellite Application Update Framework for Satellite Computing


 We release data and code used in this study to support reproducibility and future research.

 ## Evaluation Satellite Applications

 - The benchmark includes 10 representative satellite applications, labeled App1 to App10, located in the `Applications/` directory.
 - For each application, we provide the original code along with three updated versions reflecting 10%, 20%, and 50% code modifications.
    
    | AppID | Satellite Applications        |
    | ----- | ----------------------------- |
    | App1  | Object Detection              |
    | App2  | Core Network                  |
    | App3  | Image Encoding                |
    | App4  | Client Cache                  |
    | App5  | Multi-Stage Image Compression |
    | App6  | Ship Detection                |
    | App7  | Tracking Algorithm            |
    | App8  | Data Compression              |
    | App9  | Attitude Determination        |
    | App10 | Change Detection and Encoding |
